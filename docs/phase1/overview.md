# Phase 1: Core Feature Request Management (MVP)

This phase focuses on delivering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Feature Request Tracker. The primary goal is to establish the foundational capabilities for collecting, tracking, and managing feature requests.

## Features in Phase 1:

1.  **Add New Feature Request:** Users can submit new requests with essential details.
2.  **Update Request Status:** Users can modify the status of existing requests.
3.  **View All Requests:** Users can browse and view a list of all feature requests.
4.  **Delete Request:** Users can remove feature requests.

## User Journey Overview (Phase 1)

    A[User identifies a need/idea] --> B{Access Feature Request Tracker};
    B --> C{Add New Feature Request};
    C --> D[Request created with 'New' status];
    D --> E{View All Requests};
    E --> F{Select a Request};
    F --> G{Update Request Status};
    G --> H[Status updated];
    H --> I{View All Requests (updated)};
    I --> J{Decide to Delete Request (PM)};
    J --> K{Delete Request};
    K --> L[Request removed];
```

## Next Steps:

*   Create detailed feature specifications for each MVP feature.
*   Define UI/UX requirements and technical considerations for each feature.
*   Establish acceptance criteria for development and testing.
