# Product Requirements Document: Feature Request Tracker

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Feature Request Tracker, a tool designed to provide teams with a structured and efficient way to collect, manage, and track feature requests throughout their lifecycle.

## 2. Problem Statement

"Teams need a structured way to collect and track feature requests."

Currently, feature requests often come through various unstructured channels (emails, chat messages, informal conversations), leading to:
*   **Lack of Centralization:** Requests are scattered, making it difficult to get a holistic view.
*   **Poor Prioritization:** Without a clear system, prioritizing requests becomes arbitrary and subjective.
*   **Missed Opportunities:** Valuable feedback can get lost or forgotten.
*   **Inefficient Communication:** Stakeholders lack visibility into the status of their requests.

The Feature Request Tracker aims to solve these problems by providing a single source of truth for all feature requests, enabling better organization, tracking, and communication.

## 3. User Personas

### 3.1. Product Manager (PM)
*   **Description:** Responsible for defining the product vision, strategy, and roadmap. Needs to understand user needs, prioritize features, and communicate with development teams and stakeholders.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Easily collect and categorize feature requests.
    *   Gain a clear overview of all incoming requests.
    *   Track the status and progress of each request.
    *   Prioritize features based on business value and user impact.
    *   Communicate updates to stakeholders.

### 3.2. Developer
*   **Description:** Responsible for implementing features and fixing bugs. Needs clear, actionable requirements and visibility into the context and priority of their work.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Access detailed information for each feature request.
    *   Understand the current status of requests they are working on.
    *   Provide updates on implementation progress.
    *   Collaborate with PMs on technical feasibility.

## 4. Goals & Non-Goals

### 4.1. Goals
*   Provide a centralized repository for all feature requests.
*   Enable clear status tracking for each request.
*   Improve transparency and communication around feature development.
*   Streamline the process of collecting and managing user feedback.

### 4.2. Non-Goals
*   Complex project management functionalities (e.g., sprint planning, burndown charts).
*   Advanced analytics or reporting beyond basic request counts and statuses.
*   Integration with external CRM or customer support systems in the MVP.
*   User authentication and authorization beyond basic access control in the MVP.

## 5. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features

The MVP will focus on the core functionalities required to address the primary problem statement:

### 5.1. Add New Feature Request
*   **Description:** Users can submit a new feature request with essential details.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   As a Product Manager, I can create a new feature request by providing a title, description, and initial status (e.g., "New").
    *   The system automatically assigns a unique ID to each new request.
    *   The system records the creation date and the user who submitted the request.
    *   All mandatory fields (title) must be filled before submission.

### 5.2. Update Request Status
*   **Description:** Users can change the status of an existing feature request.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   As a Product Manager or Developer, I can update the status of any existing feature request (e.g., from "New" to "In Progress," "Completed," "Rejected").
    *   The system displays the current status clearly on the request details page.
    *   The system records the history of status changes (who changed it, when, and to what).

### 5.3. View All Requests
*   **Description:** Users can view a list of all feature requests.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   As a Product Manager or Developer, I can view a list of all feature requests, displaying their title, current status, and unique ID.
    *   The list should be sortable by creation date and status.
    *   I can click on a request from the list to view its full details.

### 5.4. Delete Request
*   **Description:** Users with appropriate permissions can remove a feature request.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   As a Product Manager, I can delete an existing feature request.
    *   The system prompts for confirmation before permanent deletion.
    *   Once deleted, the request is no longer visible in the system.

## 6. Dependencies & Risks

### 6.1. Dependencies
*   **Development Team Availability:** Requires dedicated engineering resources for implementation.
*   **User Feedback:** Successful validation depends on gathering feedback from target users (PMs, Developers).
*   **Technical Stack Decision:** Choice of frontend/backend technologies will impact development speed and future scalability.

### 6.2. Risks
*   **Low Adoption:** If the tool isn't intuitive or doesn't significantly improve existing workflows, teams may revert to unstructured methods.
*   **Scope Creep:** Pressure to add non-MVP features could delay launch and validation.
*   **Data Security:** Handling sensitive feature ideas requires robust data protection measures.
*   **Technical Debt:** Rapid MVP development might lead to shortcuts that need addressing later.
